# Python for Data Analysis

I read this book when I took a python course for my Master's program and was a few months away from starting the co-op where I knew I would work in python.

During my interview for the co-op, my boss Chad recommended it and it was a perfect fit for my upcoming python course where I was kind of able to direct my own learning.

At the time I had some experience with R but felt like I knew nothing about python, and this book helped a lot.

I learned about basic things like various python IDEs and debugging and then there were a few chapters such as importing data, numpy, pandas, grouping and aggregation.

Now, after this course and four months into the co-op, I am much more comfortable with python, at least for general data cleaning and transformation purposes.

The files here are the code and data from chapter 8 which covered data visualization.
