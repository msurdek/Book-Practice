#Learn Python the Hard Way




I worked though some exercises in this book when I took a python course for my Master's program and was a few months away from starting the co-op where I knew I would work in python.

At the time I had some experience with R but python seemed like a whole new world, and this book helped a lot.

The author preached about just typing things and getting them to run as being one of the best ways to learn.

I remember even struggling at the very beginning with the fact that you had to type print() to output something to the console.

Now, after this course and four months into the co-op, I am much more comfortable with python, at least for general data cleaning and transformation purposes.





The files here are the code from the typically brief exercises and some charts and other text files that were necessary.
